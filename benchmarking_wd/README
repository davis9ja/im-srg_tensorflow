Line profiling and memory profiling results (performed on Heiko's IMSRG
and TensorFlow IMSRG) are stored in the files titled "imsrgp_bench.txt"
and "tt_bench.txt". These are logs that record the time spent and
memory usage per line on every function decorated with @profile.

Line profiler   --> https://github.com/rkern/line_profiler
Memory profiler --> https://pypi.org/project/memory-profiler/

########################################################################

Any file with the suffix "_bench" is supposed to be used for profiling.
The only difference between counterparts is the @profile decorator used
for functions that were profiled.
